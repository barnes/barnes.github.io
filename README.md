# CS50 Web - Project 0
## Objective:
Create a basic HTML & CSS website to complete requirements for Project0 of Harvard's CS50 Web course. Along the way, there are a few tasks I want to personally reach.
* Use of branching and merging for each new page in the site. Probably overkill, but for practice sake.
* LOTS of use with Emmet, specificially with Bootstrap to rapidly spin up clean layouts.
* Experiment with new HTML5 features, SCSS and ensure responsive ready page.
* Perhaps experiment with Zwift API
* Perhaps play around with designing a raw CSS or SVG logo, stylized initial sort of thing.
## ToC - Projec Files
### index.html
Main homepage. Uses Bootstrap 4 navbar component that will serve as the header on all pages. Simple plain text body.

Break down of personal gardening projects. Current status of garden beds. Tables used to display layout of current raised beds. 
### zwift.html
