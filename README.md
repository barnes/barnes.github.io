# CS50 Web - Project 0
## Objective:
Create a basic HTML & CSS website to complete requirements for Project0 of Harvard's CS50 Web course. Along the way, there are a few tasks I want to personally reach.
* Use of branching and merging for each new page in the site. Probably overkill, but for practice sake.
* LOTS of use with Emmet, specificially with Bootstrap to rapidly spin up clean layouts.
* Experiment with new HTML5 features, SCSS and ensure responsive ready page.
* Perhaps experiment with Zwift API
* Perhaps play around with designing a raw CSS or SVG logo, stylized initial sort of thing.
